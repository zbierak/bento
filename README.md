All-to-all event-driven communication library out of the box

### What is bento?

Right now bento is just an idea in its author's head. If time permits, it will evolve into something actually working and this section will be updated. Until then, keep your fingers crossed.

### Prerequisites
Bento requires the following libraries:

1. [Boost 1.41](http://boost.org) or higher
2. [ZeroMQ 3.2.*](http://zeromq.org) along with [c++ bindings](https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq)

Before building bento make sure to install all the prerequisites mentioned above. Additionally, cmake is used in the build process, so you might need that one as well.
